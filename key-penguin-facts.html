	<h2>Key Penguin Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae<br />
      </li>
      <li>aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere, especially in Antarctica.<br />
      </li>
      <li>Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers.<br />
      </li>
      <li>Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid, and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans.<br />
      </li>
      <li>Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the Galápagos Penguin, lives near the equator.<br />
      </li>
      <li>The largest living species is the Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): on average adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (75 lb) or more<br />
      </li>
      <li>The smallest penguin species is the Little Blue Penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the Fairy Penguin, which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The word &quot;Penguin&quot; first appears in the 16th century as a synonym for Great Auk. It may be derived from the Welsh pen gwyn &quot;white head&quot;, although the etymology is debated. When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the Great Auk of the northern hemisphere, and named them after this bird, although they are not related.</p>
    <p>The etymology of the word &quot;penguin&quot; is still debated. The English word is not apparently of French, nor of Breton or Spanish origin (both attributed to the French word pingouin &quot;auk&quot;), but first appears in English or Dutch.</p>
    <p>Some dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh pen, &quot;head&quot; and gwyn, &quot;white&quot;, including the Oxford English Dictionary, the American Heritage Dictionary, the Century Dictionary and Merriam-Webster, on the basis that the name was originally applied to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head Island (Welsh Pen Gwyn) in Newfoundland, or because it had white circles around its eyes (though the head was black).</p>
    <p>An alternative etymology links the word to Latin pinguis which means &quot;fat&quot;. In Dutch the alternative word for penguin is 'fat-goose' and would indicate this bird received its name from its appearance.</p>
    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>The evolutionary history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary biogeography; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the alpha taxonomy of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.</p>
    <p>The basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event somewhere in the general area of (southern) New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica. Due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi) of today. The most recent common ancestor of penguins and their sister clade can be roughly dated to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, around 70–68 mya. What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the Cretaceous, the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of trophic webs that follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities</p>
    <h2>Breeding</h2>
    <p>Penguins for the most part breed in large colonies, the exceptions being the Yellow-eyed and Fiordland species; these colonies may range in size from as few as a 100 pairs for Gentoo Penguins, to several hundred thousand in the case of King, Macaroni and Chinstrap Penguins. Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual as well as vocal displays in all penguin species. Agonistic displays are those intended to confront or drive off, or alternately appease and avoid conflict with, other individuals.</p>
    <p>Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, although the two largest species, the Emperor and the King Penguins, lay only one.With the exception of the Emperor Penguin, where the male does it all, all penguins share the incubation duties.These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.</p>
    <p>Penguins generally only lay one brood; the exception is the Little Penguin, which can raise two or three broods in a season.</p>
    <p>Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 g (2 oz), the Little Penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450 g (1 lb) Emperor Penguin egg is 2.3%. The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to minimise risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large, and comprises 22–31% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain it if parents are delayed in returning with food.</p>
    <p>When mothers lose a chick, they sometimes attempt to &quot;steal&quot; another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as Emperor Penguins, young penguins assemble in large groups called crèches.</p>
