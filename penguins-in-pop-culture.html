	<h1>Penguin In Pop Culture</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Penguins are popular around the world for their unusually upright, waddling gait, their cuteness, their magnificent swimming ability and (compared with other birds) their lack of fear toward humans. Their striking black and white plumage is often likened to a tuxedo and generates humorous remarks about the bird being &quot;well dressed&quot;.</p>
	<p>Penguins had a resurgence as figures in pop culture in the mid-2000s thanks to films like March of the Penguins, Madagascar, Happy Feet, and Surf's Up.</p>
	<h2>Portayals</h2>
	<p>The penguin is typically depicted as a friendly and comical figure, with considerable dignity despite its physical limitations. Perhaps in reaction to this cute stereotype, fictional penguins are sometimes presented as irritable or even sinister. Examples include the cute yet somewhat surly Sanrio character Badtz Maru and the penguins in the movie Madagascar, intelligent creatures with devious schemes and plans, who are even capable of defeating humans. Penguins are also often portrayed as friendly and smart, for example in the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion, which features a warm-water penguin named Pen Pen.</p>

	  <li>The 1960s television cartoon character Tennessee Tuxedo would often escape the confines of his zoo with his partner, Chumley the walrus.</li>
	  <li><br />
	    In the online role-playing game RuneScape, penguins are portrayed as devious characters with a background reminiscent of the Soviet Union: their capital is Palingrad (suggesting Stalingrad); they have KGP (complare KGB) agents; and they refer to their homeland as the &quot;Motherland&quot;. One quest in which they feature is called &quot;Cold War&quot; and the next is called &quot;The Hunt for Red Raktuber&quot;, a play on The Hunt for Red October. They have an enormous military complex with training facilities, living areas, interrogation rooms and agility courses. They have plans for domination similar to the penguins in Madagascar.</li>
	  <li><br />
	    In the animated series Wallace and Gromit, a penguin called Feathers McGraw disguises himself as a chicken with a red rubber glove.</li>
	  <li>A villain in the DC Comics Universe is called The Penguin.</li>
    </ul>
	<h2>Literature</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Three children's books by Janet Perlman – The Tender Tale of Cinderella Penguin, The Emperor Penguin's New Clothes and The Penguin and the Pea – retell classic children's stories using penguin characters. Perlman also wrote the satirical graphic novel Penguins Behind Bars.</li>
	  <li>Pondus the Penguin is the eponymous main character in a 1968 photographed Danish children's book by Ivar Myrhøj.</li>
	  <li>The children's book Mr. Popper's Penguins by Richard &amp; Florence Atwater tells the story of Mr. Popper and his twelve performing penguins.</li>
	  <li>The Penguins of Doom by Greg R. Fishbone features Spots, Stripes, and Solids, three penguins who wear bow ties and follow the main character around.</li>
	  <li>Penguin Island is a satirical fictional history by Anatole France.</li>
	  <li>At the Mountains of Madness by H. P. Lovecraft features giant blind albino penguins around an underground sea in Antarctica.</li>
	  <li>And Tango Makes Three by Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell, illustrated by Henry Cole, is the true story of a penguin chick raised by two males at the Central Park Zoo in New York.</li>
    </ul>
	<h2>Film</h2>
	<ul>

	  <li>One of the main villains of the movie Batman Returns is the Penguin. In the film, the Penguin is raised by penguins and forms an army of penguins to attack Gotham City. Their equipment included back-mounted rockets and laser eye sights. The Penguin also appears in The Batman vs Dracula: The Animated Movie and Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman.</li>
	  <li>In Fight Club, the narrator's &quot;power animal&quot; is a talking King Penguin.</li>
	  <li>In 50 First Dates, a 2004 romantic comedy, the character portrayed by Adam Sandler has a pet penguin named Willie.</li>
